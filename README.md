# Learn React

{ Don's forget any deep dive }  

## Describing the UI

[[Purity: Components as formulas]](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure#purity-components-as-formulas)  
_It minds its own business_  
_Same inputs, same output_  

## Escape Hatches  

[[Best practices for DOM manipulation with refs]](https://react.dev/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs#best-practices-for-dom-manipulation-with-refs)  
_Avoid changing DOM nodes managed by React_  
_You can safely modify parts of the DOM that React has no reason to update_  

[[You might not need an Effect]](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects#you-might-not-need-an-effect)  
_Donâ€™t rush to add Effects to your components_  

[[**"Resetting all state when a prop changes**](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect#resetting-all-state-when-a-prop-changes)]  
_Always check whether you can reset all state with a key or calculate everything during rendering instead_  

## Lifecycle of Reactive Effects    

[[Challenge 5 of 5: Populate a chain of select boxes](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#populate-a-chain-of-select-boxes)]  
_Ideally, most Effects in your application should eventually be replaced by custom Hooks, whether written by you or by the community._
